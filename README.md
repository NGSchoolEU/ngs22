NGSchool2022 materials
================

Welcome to the [NGSchool2022: Machine Learning in Computational
Biology](https://ngschool.eu/ngschool2022/) materials. Here you will be
able to find links to slides, materials, repositories with code and for
some lectures videos.

Some videos are available publicly, while some are restricted to
participants of the school - they will be marked with :lock: and will
require a password to access.

Enjoy!

Workshops are marked with :computer:, panel discussion with
:speech_balloon: and lectures with :mega:.
